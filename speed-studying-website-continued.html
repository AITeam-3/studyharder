                            <li><strong>Crust</strong> - The thin, solid outer layer (5-70 km thick)</li>
                            <li><strong>Mantle</strong> - A thick layer of semi-solid rock (2900 km thick)</li>
                            <li><strong>Outer Core</strong> - A liquid layer composed mainly of iron and nickel</li>
