                        <h3>Quadratic Equations</h3>
                        <p>A quadratic equation has the standard form: ax² + bx + c = 0, where a ≠ 0.</p>
                        <p>You can solve quadratic equations using several methods:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Factoring:</strong> Find factors of the equation and set each factor equal to zero.</li>
                            <li><strong>Quadratic Formula:</strong> x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a</li>
                            <li><strong>Completing the Square:</strong> Rearrange the equation to create a perfect square trinomial.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The discriminant (b² - 4ac) tells you how many real solutions exist:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>If b² - 4ac > 0: Two distinct real solutions</li>
                            <li>If b² - 4ac = 0: One real solution (repeated root)</li>
                            <li>If b² - 4ac < 0: No real solutions (two complex solutions)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Example: Solve x² - 5x + 6 = 0</p>
                        <p>By factoring: (x - 2)(x - 3) = 0, so x = 2 or x = 3</p>

                        <p>Literary devices are techniques writers use to create meaning, enhance their writing, and connect with readers.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Common Literary Devices:</h4>
                        
                        <p><strong>1. Imagery</strong> - Language that appeals to the senses (sight, sound, taste, touch, smell).</p>
                        <p>Example: "The rusty old swing set creaked in the howling wind."</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>2. Metaphor</strong> - Direct comparison between two unlike things without using "like" or "as".</p>
                        <p>Example: "Her words were daggers to his heart."</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>3. Simile</strong> - Comparison using "like" or "as".</p>
                        <p>Example: "She ran like the wind" or "He is as stubborn as a mule."</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>4. Personification</strong> - Giving human qualities to non-human things.</p>
                        <p>Example: "The wind whispered through the trees."</p>
